# beatutiful_cal
### This tool is intended to parse ical files from MyCourses. Simply export the file from MyCourses and open it from the tool. Calendar events are then modified to look better, hopefully...
#### Currently, no manual changes can be made to the events but full customization is planned to be implemented in the future.

### TODO:
* Group events by the course code
* Group recurring events and covert to one recurring event
* Group course events by type e.g. lecture or excercise
* Add nice menu to configure courses
* Configurator:
  Possibility to select which courses to include. Possibility to select which events to include inside a course. Feature which allows to set the end and start dates for the calendar. Full customization support for all values and support to add own events and details.
